# Calender_in_C

Creating a calendar in C is a classic programming project that can serve as an excellent learning exercise for beginners and a practical utility for more experienced programmers. 

The goal of this project is to develop a simple command-line calendar application in the C programming language. This calendar program will allow users to view, navigate, and manage events and appointments for a given month and year. It should provide basic calendar functionalities, such as displaying the calendar grid, adding events, viewing events, and navigating between different months and years.

# Key Features:

A) **Display Calendar Grid:** The program should display a calendar grid, showing the days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) and the days of the month. Users should be able to see the current month's calendar.

B) **Navigation:** Users should be able to navigate to different months and years. They can move forward or backward, or jump to a specific month and year.

C) **Event Management: **Users should have the ability to add, edit, and delete events or appointments on specific dates. Events can have a title, time, and description.

D) **View Events:** The program should allow users to view events for a specific day, week, or month. It should also provide options to filter events based on dates and times.

E) **Save and Load Data:** Implement functionality to save calendar data to a file and load it when the program starts, ensuring that events persist between program sessions.

F) **Reminder System:** Optionally, you can include a reminder system to notify users of upcoming events.


# Challenges:

a) Implementing date calculations, such as determining the first day of the month and the number of days in a month.
b) Designing a user-friendly interface for command-line interaction.
c) Managing event data efficiently, possibly using data structures like arrays or linked lists.
d) Handling user input validation to prevent errors and crashes.
e) Implementing a file I/O system for data persistence.
